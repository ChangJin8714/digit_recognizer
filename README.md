This repository contains code for recognizing digits using Neural Networks. It is developed as part of the competition **Digit Recognizer** hosted by *Kaggle*.
Check out this link for more details : https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

## Visualization
The file *digit_recognizer.py* suppports plot for accuracies. Other additions should be straight-forward

## Results
The **output** folder contains the results of running the network. The best accuracy of **0.99829** was achieved using Convolutional Networks with Rectified Linear Units.


## Dependencies
This code is written in python. To use it you will need:
- Python 2.7
- Theano 0.7
- A recent version of NumPy and matlplotlib
